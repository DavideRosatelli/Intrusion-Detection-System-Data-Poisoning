## A Cybersecurity application o Data Science: Intrusion Detection Systems and Data Poisoning
This work was the code employed for my thesis for the Master of Science in Data Science and Management at Luiss Guido Carli University.

Its main objectives are to build a IDS trough classification tasks perfromed by several machine learning and deep learning tecniques, in the binary form attack or normal activity, and in the multiclass form, identifiyng the kind of attack.
Then, the same algorithms were used with the dataset modified, simulating two types of data poisoning, with different intensity levels, in order to analyze the impact of the modifications on the models' performance.
